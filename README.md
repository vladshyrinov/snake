This project is inspired by the idea to create the well known and favourite to everybody *Snake game*, but with a couple interesting additions and lovely interface.
The game is available to play on mobile phone, Mac or PC.

## Link to play

## Game rules

You play with the green and tiny snake, you goal is to earn so many points as possible.

To earn points all you need to do is eating food that will appear.

If you occasionaly cut the snake (hitting your snake body with the head) points will be divided by 2.

Hitting the wall ends the game.

### Food types

1. Usual
