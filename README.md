## Game rules

You play with the green and tiny snake, you goal is to earn so many points as possible.

To earn points all you need to do is eating food that will appear.

If you occasionaly cut the snake (hitting your snake body with the head) points will be divided by 2.

Hitting the wall ends the game.

### Food types
There are 2 types of food: 
1. Usual
    - Every time you eat usual food, the new one will appear
